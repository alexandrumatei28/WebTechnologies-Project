# Nobil Equestrian School Website

## Overview
This project is a website developed during my first year of university for a fictional equestrian center called "Școala de Echitație Nobil" (Nobil Equestrian School). The site serves as an informational and interactive platform for horse riding enthusiasts, offering details about the center's services, history, pricing, and contact information.

## Features
- **Homepage**: Introduces the equestrian school with a welcoming message, an image banner, and an overview of what sets the center apart.
- **About Us**:
  - "Începuturi" (Beginnings) section detailing the history of the center, founded in 2012 by Andreea and George, with their first horse, Charlie.
  - Contact page with address, email, phone number, operating hours, and a Google Maps embed.
- **Services**: Highlights offerings such as riding lessons for all levels, horse boarding, competitions, and cart rides, with photos and a YouTube video embed.
- **Pricing**: A detailed table listing the costs and durations of various services (e.g., riding lessons, forest rides, horse boarding).
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - A form for users to sign up for the club, with fields for personal details and activity preferences, stored in `localStorage`.
  - Dynamic animations like rotating images, a shaking effect on social media icons, and a button that triggers an alert.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes using CSS media queries, ensuring accessibility on mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structures the content across multiple pages (`index.html`, `inceputuri.html`, `contact.html`, `servicii.html`, `pret.html`).
- **CSS**: Provides styling and layout, including a custom font ("Jost"), animations (e.g., `@keyframes`), and a responsive design with media queries.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, such as DOM manipulation, event listeners (e.g., `click`, `keydown`), `setInterval` for animations, `localStorage` for form data, and dynamic style changes.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main landing page.
- `inceputuri.html`: History of the equestrian center.
- `contact.html`: Contact details and sign-up form.
- `servicii.html`: Services offered by the center.
- `pret.html`: Pricing information.

- `nobil.js`: JavaScript file for interactivity and functionality.
- `fonts/`, `images/`: Assets including the custom font and images used throughout the site.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to explore the site.
3. Ensure an internet connection for the Google Maps embed and YouTube video to load properly.

## Purpose
This project was created as part of a university assignment to demonstrate skills in web development, including HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. It reflects a blend of creativity and technical ability, showcasing a fully functional and visually appealing website.
